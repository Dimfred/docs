Alephium's stateful UTXO model combines the advantages of the UTXO and
account models. It supports mutable states for smart contracts, like
those found in Ethereum, while leveraging the security benefits of the
immutable UTXO model for assets.

This design is quite unique in the space and has implications to
Alephium's programming model, its approach to securing asset
management, the token design, and more.
